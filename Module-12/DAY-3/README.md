# Ex.No:12(C)             JAVA STACK & VECTOR
 ## AIM :

To Write a java program to create vector and read the elements for two vector in java collection.(Use equals method )
## ALGORITHM :

1.	Start the Program
2.	In `main`:
-	a) Create a `Scanner` object to read input.
-	b) Read an integer `n1` (the size of the first vector).
-	c) Initialize `Vector<String> vector1`.
-	d) Use a `for` loop to read `n1` strings and add each to `vector1`.
3.	Repeat similar steps for a second vector:
a)	Read an integer `n2` (size of the second vector).
b)	Initialize `Vector<String> vector2`.
c)	Use a `for` loop to read `n2` strings and add each to `vector2`.
4.	Use `equals()` to compare `vector1` and `vector2` and print whether they are equal.
5.	End.
